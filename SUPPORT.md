# Jenkins Infrastructure Support

Our infrastructure is an open project made by and for the Jenkins community.
It is maintained and supported by the [Jenkins Infrastructure team](https://jenkins.io/projects/infrastructure/).
This team consists of Jenkins contributors and volunteers who provide a best-effort support depending on their availability and other commitments.
There is no guarantee of immediate response or issue resolution.
Contributions are welcome and much appreciated, see the [contributing guidelines](https://jenkins.io/projects/infrastructure/#contributing)!
